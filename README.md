# Relationship between COVID-19 Severity and Travelling
## UBC ECON 323 Project (2021 Winter Term 1)

**Project Background:**

As vaccines become more effective and new booster shots become available, it seems like the world is transitioning to a “new normal” during the pandemic. Many countries indeed opened up borders for international travelling and non-citizen entry. Tourism is a major source of revenue for many countries and cities and the world now questions whether tourism can also resume back to normal.

**Project Overview:**

This is a study conducted on whether there is a correlation between the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and the number of tourists from a group of selected countries. I extracted data from John Hopkins University for the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and governmental sites for the number of tourists arrivals for each country from June 2020 to May 2021. My conclusion of this study is that the number of tourists in each country does not directly depend on COVID-19 severity and the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases in each country. In fact, I propose that the number of tourists during pandemic will likely be directly impacted by other factors such as policy changes, governmental regulations, presence of vaccines, and cultural believe differences.
